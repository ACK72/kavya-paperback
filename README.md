[`https://ACK72.github.io/paperback-extension`](https://ACK72.github.io/paperback-extension)

## Limitations

- Metadata of peoples are not supported, as it requires expensive search functions for paperback, to be applied.
- Unfortunately, as paperback uses image caching internally, it might be unable to support progress synchronization, even with OPDS-PS.
